In the past, using CFX Keymaster made it impossible to build CI/CD pipelines for
Escrow Resources due to the Cloudflare Bot Challenge.

However, CFX has now created a new platform called **"Portal"**, which is still
secured via Cloudflare but operates in a less restrictive attack mode, enabling
its use within a GitHub Action.

## How to Use It

To use this action, you need to authenticate via the forum using a cookie until
CFX provides API keys for this action.

1. Go to the **CFX Forum** and inspect the site using your browser's developer
   tools.
1. Navigate to the **Cookies** section and search for `_t`.
1. Copy the value of this cookie and save it in GitHub Secrets as
   `FORUM_COOKIE`.
1. Use the action in your workflow (remember to
   [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) before!):

   ```yaml
   - name: Upload Escrow Resource
     uses: luman-studio/cfx-portal-upload
     with:
       cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
       assetName: 'my_asset'
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When you log out of the forum, the cookie will become invalid, causing the
> action to fail. After configuring the secret, you should clear the cookie from
> your browser and log in again to avoid potential issues.

## Multi-Version Upload Support

This action supports uploading multiple versions of your resource in a single
workflow run:

### Escrowed and Open Source Versions

Upload both escrowed and open source versions from the current branch:

```yaml
- name: Upload to CFX Portal
  uses: luman-studio/cfx-portal-upload@main
  with:
    cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
    escrowed: |
      asset_id: "534535"
      asset_name: "my-resource-escrowed"
      escrow_ignore: ['init.lua', 'shared/config.lua', 'shared/utils.lua']
    openSource: |
      asset_id: "534536"
      asset_name: "my-resource-source"
```

### High Quality (HQ) and Low Quality (LQ) Versions

Upload different quality versions from different branches (e.g., `main` for HQ
and `low-quality` for LQ):

```yaml
- name: Upload to CFX Portal
  uses: luman-studio/cfx-portal-upload@main
  with:
    cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
    hq: |
      asset_id: "534537"
      asset_name: "my-resource-hq"
      branch: "main"
      escrow_ignore: ['init.lua', 'shared/config.lua']
    lq: |
      asset_id: "534538"
      asset_name: "my-resource-lq"
      branch: "low-quality"
      escrow_ignore: ['init.lua', 'shared/config.lua']
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When using HQ/LQ versions, make sure to checkout with `fetch-depth: 0` to
> fetch all branches:
>
> ```yaml
> - name: Checkout code
>   uses: actions/checkout@v4
>   with:
>     fetch-depth: 0
> ```

### Combining All Options

You can combine escrowed, open source, HQ, and LQ versions in a single workflow:

```yaml
- name: Upload to CFX Portal
  uses: luman-studio/cfx-portal-upload@main
  with:
    cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
    escrowed: |
      asset_id: "534535"
      asset_name: "my-resource-escrowed"
      escrow_ignore: ['init.lua', 'shared/config.lua']
    openSource: |
      asset_id: "534536"
      asset_name: "my-resource-source"
    hq: |
      asset_id: "534537"
      asset_name: "my-resource-hq"
      branch: "main"
    lq: |
      asset_id: "534538"
      asset_name: "my-resource-lq"
      branch: "low-quality"
```

## Features

- 🚀 **Automated Building**: Automatically builds `web` and `dui` folders using
  pnpm before upload
- 📦 **Multi-Version Support**: Upload escrowed, open source, HQ, and LQ
  versions in one workflow
- 🔀 **Branch-Based Versions**: Create different quality versions from different
  Git branches
- 🔒 **Configurable Escrow**: Define which files should remain unobfuscated via
  `escrow_ignore`
- 📝 **Metadata Updates**: Automatically updates `fxmanifest.lua` with resource
  name, author, version, and description
- 📤 **Chunked Upload**: Supports large file uploads with configurable chunk
  size (default 2MB)
- 🔄 **Cookie Refresh**: Scheduled workflow support to keep authentication
  active

## Skip Upload

If you haven't uploaded an asset in a long time, the cookie will become invalid
due to inactivity. To prevent this, you can use a cron job to log in to the
portal and refresh the cookie.

```yaml
name: Refresh Cookie

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  refresh_cookie:
    name: Login to Portal
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run CFX Portal Upload
        uses: luman-studio/cfx-portal-upload@main
        with:
          cookie: ${{ secrets.FORUM_COOKIE }}
          skipUpload: true
```
